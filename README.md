# Mirror
#### by Beidi Han

## Overview
It is an adventure RPG game that reveals the inequality between the poor and the rich in the real world through storytelling. As the title mirror expresses, this game aims to show players the inequality that can occur in reality. At the same time, it also expresses the concept that the two countries in the game are actually mirrored worlds in terms of structure. Use p5.play library and RPG Maker to complete the game development.

##### Technical Details
This program uses the p5.play game library and the register states through the AdventureStates.csv file, which contains information about each state. By using this library function, it can handle the changes of each PNGRoom, so as to get a completely different display effect.
